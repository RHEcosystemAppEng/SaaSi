## Exporter - infra
The exporter is the component which collects the needed infrastructure details
to generate a YAML manifest that could be used to setup the lab by the
[`ocp-lab-provisioner`](https://github.com/RHEcosystemAppEng/ocp_labs_provisioner)
tool.

The exporter requires the `oc` CLI installed and configured to access the
Openshift cluster that you want to clone. To run it, please use the following
commands:
```sh
# Access the exporter's folder
cd exporter

# Check your oc cli connection
oc cluster-info

# Run the exporter
./exporter.sh

# Check results
ls ./results
```

### Customization
After the env var is created containing all the required parameters, the next
step is to apply the custom configuration file including also the generated file
in the previous step.
```
# An example of this file could be found here:
vim custom_config.env

# Run parser
./parser.sh \
  -s ./results/<SOURCE_CLUSTER_FILE>.env \
  -c ./<CUSTOMIZATION_FILE>.env
```
